			<p>The <a href="https://www.usamemorychampionship.com/">USAMC</a>, or the USA Memory Championship, is a event designed at testing the limits of human memory. There are three qualifying events:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Names and Faces</li>
				<li>Speed Numbers</li>
				<li>Speed Cards</li>
				<li>Speed Poetry</li>
			</ul>
			<p>And three championship events:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Words to Remember</li>
				<li>Three Strikes You're Out</li>
				<li>Double Deck O'Cards</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On this training site, we provide native support for Names and Faces, Speed Numbers, Words to Remember, and Three Strikes You're Out. For card related events (Speed Cards and Double Deck O'Cards), I believe it is more effective to practice by using an actual deck of cards, so we will provide you with only a timer. For Speed Poetry, we provide native support with the asterisk that I can not not feasibly provide unpublished poetry, so you may have seen some.</p>
