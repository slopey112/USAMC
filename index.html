			<p>The <a href="https://www.usamemorychampionship.com/">USAMC</a>, or the USA Memory Championship, is a event designed at testing the limits of human memory. This website is a way to practice for the competition. For all events except for card-related events, we feature on-site practice. For card-related events, we believe you will gain more from practicing with a real deck of cards, so we only feature a timer. We hope you enjoy using our website.</p>
